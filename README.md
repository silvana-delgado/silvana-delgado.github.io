## Hola!

I am Silvana (she/her/hers), a 4th year Astronomy Ph.D. candidate at Texas A&M University. 
In my research, I build dynamical models for galaxies to study their stars, dark matter, and 
the supermassive black hole. 

I am from Ecuador and I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a 
bachelor's degree in Astronomy and Physics.
